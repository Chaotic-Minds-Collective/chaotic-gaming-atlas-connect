# CMG Connect

Cross-grid chat, scheduled announcements, MOTDs, rules, invite links and Discord relays.

This Chaotic Minds Gaming (CMG) module extends [CMG Core](https://github.com/Chaotic-Minds-Collective/cmg-atlas-core-plugin) and the [ATLAS integration adapter](https://github.com/Chaotic-Minds-Collective/cmg-atlas-plugin); it does not replace either foundation.

## Feature scope

- Global/grid chat with origin labels
- Tribe chat gated by membership
- Scheduled announcements and maintenance notices
- Login MOTDs, rules and invite links
- Discord relay with allowlists, anti-loop controls and rate limits
- Scoped admin broadcasts and audit

## Current implementation

- `src/message.js`: immutable schema-v1 public message envelope and pure relay policy. It validates scope, origin, channel type, provider tribe ID, content, allowlists, loop history and a two-hop ceiling. It does not send messages.
- `src/core-event.js`: normalizes Core's documented `game.event.received` outbox wrapper for `chat.global` and `chat.tribe`. It preserves the Core record/event IDs, timestamp, correlation ID, cluster/grid/server scope and an immutable copy of the provider payload.

Core's published contract defines the outbox wrapper and normalized event types, but does not define a canonical inner chat payload, player display identity, or Connect destination/origin channel mapping. The adapter therefore preserves the inner payload as opaque JSON and does not fabricate message content, author identity, or channel routing.

## Architecture and dependencies

- Core identity, scoped RBAC, server registry and outbox
- ATLAS adapter: verified connect/disconnect/chat callbacks
- CMG Tribes for membership
- Discord service integration; Discord roles are not Core permissions

Core remains authoritative for shared identity, authorization and platform records. ATLAS-native calls pass through the shared adapter. This module owns its domain state and must not connect directly to PostgreSQL.

## Development

Requires Node.js 22 or newer.

```sh
npm run check
npm test
```

GitHub Actions runs the same checks for pushes and pull requests.

## Safety and compatibility

- Only explicitly allowlisted public destinations may be considered for relay.
- Never relay private messages or unapproved channels.
- Relay history prevents immediate loops; production delivery still needs durable deduplication, bounded retries and reconnect tests.
- Native ATLAS chat/login hooks are unverified; no in-game UI or live relay capability is claimed.
- No production deployment, Discord connection, credential, database access or live server change is included.
